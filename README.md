# Development Methodology

## AI-Assisted Project Planning

This project used AI (Claude) to create a structured execution plan
with realistic milestones and time-boxing. This approach helped combat
common developer challenges:

- Scope creep and feature bloat
- Unlimited research without implementation
- Half-finished projects
- Unrealistic timelines

The AI provided:

- Project management framework
- TDD milestone suggestions
- Time-boxed research phases
- Accountability structure

I was responsible for:

- All technical decisions (documented in ADRs)
- Code implementation and learning
- Test design and implementation  
- Problem-solving and debugging
- Scope adjustments based on real constraints
